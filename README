## Connected object client

# hardware
raspberry pi 2, an arduino connected to the pi via USB (serial) and a raspberry-camera.
The arduino connects to three neopixels via GPIO-6 and changes the colors of the LEDs by software

# software
node.js, express.js, node-pixel, shell.js and the request module.

# what it does
the client software establishes a connection to a socket-server that acts as an API for the object.
If the right events come up, the client switches on the LEDs and changes the colors. After each color change,
a photo is created locally on the pi and uploaded to the server afterwards via request module.

# app engine commands
gcloud preview app deploy app.yaml --promote
